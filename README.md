# Aws-DevSecOps-Pipeline
End-to-end Secure DevSecOps pipeline automating AWS infrastructure with Terraform, Docker image scanning with Trivy, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
# 🚧 WIP: Secure DevSecOps Pipeline (AWS & Terraform)

**Status:** Work In Progress 🛠️ (Started: Feb 20, 2026)

## 📌 Project Objective
This repository will contain an end-to-end automated CI/CD pipeline built from scratch. The goal is to integrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC), container security scanning, and automated deployments to catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.

## 🏗️ Planned Architecture & Tech Stack
I am currently building and integrating the following tools:
* **Cloud & IaC:** AWS (EC2, S3), Terraform
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
* **Containers:** Docker
* **Security Scanning:** Trivy, Shell Scripting

## 🚀 Upcoming Milestones
- [ ] Step 1: Create a basic application to act as the test target.
- [ ] Step 2: Set up Terraform for AWS infrastructure provisioning (Remote State).
- [ ] Step 3: Write secure, non-root Dockerfile.
- [ ] Step 4: Build GitHub Actions workflow integrating Trivy scans.
- [ ] Step 5: Deploy to AWS and document trade-offs.

> *Follow my progress! This README will be updated as the pipeline is built.*
